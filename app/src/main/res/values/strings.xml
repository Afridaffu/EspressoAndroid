    <string name="merchants_agreements">Thank you for selecting the payment processing services offered by Intuit Inc., Intuit Payment Solutions, LLC, and/or its subsidiaries and affiliates (referred to as “Intuit”, “we”, “our” or “us”) for your payment processing needs. Please review this Merchant Agreement (“Agreement”) thoroughly as it is a legal contract between Intuit and you. This Agreement addresses important terms such as pricing, your responsibility with respect to chargebacks from your customers, our ability to hold your funds in reserve, the process for any disputes that might arise, and information security, all of which (and more) are addressed in detail below.  In this Agreement, “you”, “your”, and “Merchant” collectively refers to you as an individual, together with the business entity on whose behalf you are acting and its designated agents, principals, guarantors, or owners. By applying for or using the Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Agreement.  A.     GENERAL TERMS 1. Agreement. This Agreement describes the terms governing your use of our card, ACH (electronic bank payment), and other payment processing services (collectively, “Services”), which will enable you to receive payments from your customers. In connection with enabling you to receive payments from your customers through the Services, you hereby appoint Intuit as your limited payments agent for the purpose of receiving, holding, and settling payments to you pursuant to this Agreement. You further agree and understand that a payment received by Intuit, on your behalf, satisfies your customer’s obligation to pay you, regardless of whether Intuit actually settles such payment to you. In the event that Intuit does not make any such payment to you as described in this Agreement, you will have recourse against only Intuit and not against your customer. This Agreement governs your use of the Services and includes by reference:  Intuit’s Privacy Statement, Acceptable Use Policy, and Pricing Schedules provided to you on this website or otherwise. Additional Terms and Conditions, as provided, which may include those from third parties (such as the Commercial Entity Agreement). Any terms provided separately to you for the Services, including product or program terms, ordering/pricing, activation, payment terms, etc.    2. Eligibility. The Services are available only in the United States (but not the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories and possessions). To be eligible to use the Services, you: must not be domiciled, reside, or have a principal place of business outside the United States; must not be engaged in any illegal activity or any activity reasonably likely to cause notoriety, harm, or damage to the reputation of Intuit, our sponsor banks, and card or payment networks (such as VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, JCB, NACHA, and Apple Pay); must not be listed on a VISA Terminated Merchant File, MasterCard MATCH, or any other third party or governmental prohibited merchant or individual lists; and must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy. If previously identified by VISA risk programs, you must self-disclose when the identification occurred and under what specific programs. You may only use the Services for the business and purpose described by you in your Merchant Application (see Section 6 below).     3. Your Responsibility. Intuit requires that a principal or owner of the business accept this Agreement and liability for all obligations of the business under this Agreement. You are confirming that you are either a principal or owner of your business and/or are authorized to act on the business’ behalf. You agree and understand that Intuit’s decision to enter into this Agreement and provide the Services is conditioned on both the principal or owner’s personal financial stability and that of the business, and you hereby authorize us to conduct any necessary identity, credit, and financial status checks at any time, be it during the application process or throughout the term of this Agreement, to determine your and the business’ creditworthiness and/or ability to perform the obligations hereunder. Late payments, missed payments, non-payments, and other defaults on your Merchant Account may be reflected in your business’ credit report and/or your personal or individual credit report.     4. Verification; Credit Checks. You agree and authorize us (directly or through third parties) to make any inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and account information, or to determine your current and ongoing creditworthiness, financial status, and/or ability to perform the obligations hereunder. This may include asking you to confirm your email address, mobile/phone numbers, or bank accounts, or by verifying your information against third-party databases (including by obtaining your individual and business credit report, personal profile, or other information from one or more third-party databases). If you are a QuickBooks merchant, you agree that we may access and use your QuickBooks account information for underwriting, identity verification, or fraud analysis purposes. Additionally, you agree that your bank and the consumer reporting agencies may release any and all individual and business credit and financial information to us. You further authorize us to disclose any information obtained from any source (including credit reports) to any governmental, administrative, or regulatory entity, our respective vendors and affiliates for fraud or verification purposes, any third party to the extent such parties provide Services to you or us, or to comply with applicable law or investigation, including, without limitation, the USA PATRIOT Act. You acknowledge and agree that we may request that you provide additional information at any time, including but not limited to: a copy of a government-issued ID (such as a passport or driver’s license); your business license; taxpayer ID number; financial or bank statements; utility bills; or your personal or business tax returns. You consent to us updating your account information from time to time based on information provided by you, your bank, other payments services providers, or other reliable data sources used to evaluate the current status of the business and/or its owners.     5. Participating Sponsor Banks; Commercial Entity Agreements. You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is between you and Intuit, not with any other third party (including, but not limited to, any card or payment network such as MasterCard, VISA, JCB, Discover, American Express, Apple Pay, or any of our sponsor banks), however, these third parties are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement. We may require that you enter into separate and direct agreements (a “Commercial Entity Agreement”) with one or more of our sponsor banks or card networks if your processing volume exceeds certain threshold amounts. A copy of the Commercial Entity Agreement can be found in our Legal Documents page which shall be in effect, and considered accepted by you, upon your exceeding such threshold amounts. In certain circumstances, new pricing terms, including but not limited to card processing rates and fees, may apply. You agree that our sponsor bank and all parties to a Commercial Entity Agreement may rely on the information you provided in your Merchant Application for approval and underwriting of your Commercial Entity Agreement. Terms of the Commercial Entity Agreement will govern your use of the specific services contemplated under the Commercial Entity Agreement.     6. Merchant Application; Updating Your Information. You must complete a payment processing services application (“Merchant Application”) and be approved by our underwriting system prior to your use of the Services. Once approved, you will be issued a Merchant Account (see Section 11 below). You understand that our release of any payments funds to you is subject to our credit and Merchant Application approval, and your receipt of a Merchant Account. If, for any reason, your Merchant Application is denied, any payment funds held by us will be returned to your customers. You agree that the information you provided in the Merchant Application (or otherwise requested by Intuit as part of an application or investigation process) is true, accurate, and complete. You agree to update us on an ongoing basis with: a list of principals, owners, or officers for your business including their home addresses, personal and business telephone numbers, and email addresses; all “Doing Business As” (DBA) names used by you; your business address and telephone number; the URL (web address) for your business; and a complete description of goods and services provided by your business. If the scope or nature of your business, or the type of products or services you offer changes, you agree to notify us prior to such change. You are liable to us for all losses and expenses incurred by us arising out of your failure to report any changes to us. Intuit reserves the right to immediately terminate this Agreement or suspend your access to the Services in the event of a change in information you previously provided to us.     7. Pricing and Payment. For a list of rates and fees, see the Pricing Schedules. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Pricing Schedule, this Agreement shall control. All rates and fees are in U.S. dollars and subject to change; where you may become subject to any increase in rates or fees, we will provide thirty (30) days advance notice. We may provide you notice by posting updated pricing or terms on our website or sending you email communication. Price changes are effective on the date indicated on our notice or posted terms. By continuing to access and use the Services after we have provided you any price changes, you are agreeing to such changes. All fees due in connection with the Service are non-refundable, whether such fees are set-up fees, transaction fees, monthly subscription fees, or other fees. You may incur price increases should you request changes to Service offerings, including, without limitation, moving Services from QuickBooks Online to QuickBooks Desktop, and you agree to pay the increased fee starting on the date of confirmation of your Service offering change. You agree to immediately pay us all fees set forth in your Merchant Application, the applicable Pricing Schedule, and/or in other provisions of this Agreement. You agree that you will also be responsible for any Chargebacks and any fees, fines, or penalties assessed to us or to you by any card or payment network as a consequence of your use or misuse of the Services or your card processing activities. You agree that we may collect fees and other amounts owed under this Agreement by different means, including but not limited to: netting against the proceeds of your processing activity; debiting your Bank Account, Reserve Account, or any other account you may have at any financial institution; or exercising any other legal rights and remedies we may have under law or equity. You agree that we may collect reasonable fees (including attorney’s fees) arising out of, or related to, our efforts to collect fees or other amounts from you. If you wish to dispute payment to, or collection by Intuit of any fee, you must provide written notice of such dispute within forty-five (45) days after you received a statement containing the fee, as described in Section 15 below.     8. Limits. We may establish processing limits and assign a maximum dollar amount per transaction and/or an aggregate maximum dollar amount per calendar month (or any other time period we designate) that you may process using the Services. You may request an increase in your per transaction limit or your aggregate processing volume by submitting a request to us. Any increase shall be at our sole discretion, and we reserve the right to reverse and decrease any maximum amounts previously authorized. Any increase granted by us may be conditional upon and require the establishment of a Reserve Account (defined in Section 13 below). You agree that your activity will remain consistent with approved processing limits. Intuit may require additional documentation if you exceed your approved processing limits and you agree to promptly provide such documentation upon request. You agree that Intuit may, in its sole discretion, elect not to process transactions over your approved aggregate processing volume or per transaction limits, and/or to suspend or terminate your Merchant Account in the event of over-limit transactions.     9. Settlement of Transactions. Intuit will accept all valid transactions processed by you under this Agreement and shall present the same to the appropriate financial institution for collection against your customer’s or payor’s account. Settlement of all transactions is subject to this Agreement and applicable Rules. Intuit may provisionally credit to you the value of a processed transaction but reserves the right to adjust amounts credited to you to reflect the value of Chargebacks, fees, penalties, the difference in currency exchange if the Chargeback amount is greater than the original sale, issuer claims, and items for which Intuit did not receive final payment for any reason. We may refuse to accept any transaction or revoke our prior acceptance or settlement of a transaction in the following circumstances: (a) the transaction resulting in a receipt that was not made in compliance with all the terms and conditions of this Agreement; (b) a customer or payor disputes their liability for any reason, including but not limited to those Chargeback rights provided in the applicable Rules; (c) a transaction resulting in a receipt that was not directly between you and a cardholder or payor; or (d) a transaction that is outside the parameters indicated on the Merchant Application. You agree to pay for any amount previously credited to you and not accepted or later revoked by Intuit. Intuit will not be liable for any claims or damages arising from your use of any third parties, including service providers who submit your transactions to us on your behalf. Intuit does not recommend or endorse any third parties even if such provider is using our API’s (Application Programming Interface) to access your information or deliver you services. You acknowledge that if you authorize Intuit to share your information with a third party, you will be subject to the third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policy, and Intuit will not be able to control their use of your data. Additionally, the third party’s operations, service performance, or restrictions may impact the Services. You acknowledge that Intuit is not responsible for acts of any third party, including any delays, security breaches, or any failure to settle transactions with you due to reasons not within our control, such as inaccurate information or fraud.     10. Bank Account. You will need to establish and maintain a debit-enabled account (“Bank Account”) at a U.S. depository financial institution to facilitate payment of fees to Intuit and the transfer of amounts due to you from your Merchant Account. You irrevocably authorize Intuit and our sponsor banks to immediately debit your Bank Account for any and all fraudulent transactions, any negative balance in your Merchant Account, for current and past due fees, payment equipment rentals/purchases, fines, penalties, or any amounts you owe us under this Agreement. You agree that Intuit shall not incur any liability for any loss, costs, or fees incurred by you that are the result of such debits by us. We may take reasonable steps to verify your Bank Account information, for example, by requiring you to provide us a cancelled check or by debiting and crediting micro-deposits into your Bank Account, including on a recurring basis. You agree that you will not change your Bank Account without our prior consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld. If you do not obtain such prior consent, Intuit may immediately terminate this Agreement.     11. Your Merchant Account. Following approval of your Merchant Application, you must open a merchant service account with us (“Merchant Account”) to use the Services. The proceeds from your card and other payment transactions processed using the Services (“Settlement Funds”) will be recorded in your Merchant Account and we will transfer funds to your Bank Account. Settlement Funds do not constitute a deposit you have with us, will bear no interest, and are not eligible for insurance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). As permitted by law, we may consolidate any or all funds payable to you and offset any outstanding/uncollected amounts owed by you to us (pursuant to this Agreement or any other agreement between you and Intuit) from any funds we are obligated to deposit into your Bank Account.</string>
